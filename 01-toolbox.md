# 01 - Toolbox tips

- DevDocs.io is an awesome tool to have documentation at hand and available even while offline. There's also a Desktop app for it: https://devdocs.egoist.moe/
- https://insomnia.res is a nice software to test REST APIs (runs on Linux)
- Visual Studio Code is a pretty neat editor to work with JavaScript. Saved my preferences here: https://github.com/meleu/vscode-preferences
