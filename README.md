# gostack-bootcamp-notes

Some notes about what I've been learning in the [GoStack Bootcamp](https://rocketseat.com.br/gostack).

To be honest these notes were not written in a way to be "consumed" by others, but mostly like my personal notes. I'm using a github repo to make it easier to edit the notes when working on different computers (by the way, I use the [https://stackedit.io/](https://stackedit.io/) to edit them).
